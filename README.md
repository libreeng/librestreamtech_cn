# librestreamtech_cn
This repo is for www.librestreamtech.cn, Librestream's website in China. Initially, it is a static site on a storage account in Azure China and does not have proper brandining. This repo will allow Hatchery access to work on it.

The contents of the footer, the ICP and PSB numbers with links, need to be on all pages. This is a requirement of hosting in China.
